# Blue Archive Notes

Small notes app inspired by the assets from the Blue Archive 100 days celebration (https://bluearchive.nexon.com/events/2022/02/100days).

Not affiliated in any way with Blue Archive. This is just a fan project.

Note: given my abysmal knowledge of OpenGL and platform specific stuff, it's very likely that you won't be able to run this project as-is.

## Goals

- Learn how to model and render digital ink
- Learn how to integrate OpenGL with other stuff
- Improve my C++ (or at least stop getting segfaults all the time)
- Make a cute notes app for personal use

## Libraries and tools

- OpenGL
- GLAD
- GLFW
- Wintab (headers from Wacom sample code at https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/wacom-device-kit-windows/tree/master/Wintab%20ScribbleDemo)
- stb_image.h by Sean Barrett (https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
